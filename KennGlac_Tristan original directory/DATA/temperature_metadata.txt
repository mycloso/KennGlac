Metadata for modified temperature data files:
1. temperature_meta
2. daily_temperature_data
3. daily_tavg

This txt file describes data contents, the raw source data and metadata, operations done to the data, column headers, and units.
# -----------------------
1. temperature_meta:
# -----------------------
- this file contains useful metadata variables for each met station.
- data in this file all came from metadata sheets for individual stations which are as follows:
	1. Gates Glacier = "GGLA2_metadata_CAKN_README.txt"
	2. May Creek (SNOTEL and FIRE RAWS) = "GHCDN_GatesMay_metadata.txt"
	3. Pascal Buri AWS = "BURI_AWS_2019_metadata.pdf"
	4. USGS Gage Station = "USGS_15209700_airtemp_metadata.txt"
	5. NWS Coop Observations = NWS_coop_505757_metadata.txt"
- The only operations done on these data were unit conversions. The elevation of the USGS site should be verified.  
- Columns and units are as follows:
	1. el = site elevation in meters
	2. lat = site latitude in degrees
	3. lon = site longitude in degrees 
	4. ID = station ID, where applicable. Note that this field was not used in any of the work so far and could be eliminated.


# ------------------------
2. daily_temperature_data:
# ------------------------
- this file contains daily temperature indices for Gates, May Creek, Buri, USGS, and Coop meteorological sites from 2016 to 2020. 
Data from each site will be described individually. 
- Columns and Units for all sites are consistent:
	1. TMIN = minimum daily air temperature
	2. TAVG = average daily air temperature
	3. TMAX = maximum daily air temperature

Gates Glacier:
	- raw temperature data are found in the files "WC_G_GGLA2.csv" (2016 - 2019) and "GGLA2.2020-07-07.csv" (preliminary 2019-2020 data).  
	- preliminary data time stamps were coerced to hourly time steps, time stamps were converted from utc to AK DST time zone, 
		temperature values were converted from Fahrenheit to Celcius, and data were resampled to daily intervals.
		

May Creek:
	- raw temperature data are found in the file "MayCreekRAWS_19900501-20200713.csv".
	- Hourly time stamps were converted to DST, temperature values converted to celcius, and data resampled to daily intervals.

Buri AWS
	- raw temperature data are from file "BURI_AWS_2019.txt"
	- Raw data in hourly intervals. A new date index columns was put in to avoid some incorrect dates in spreadsheet and data were resampled to daily intervals.

USGS Site
	- raw temperature data are found in file "USGS_15209700_airtemp.csv".
	- Raw 15-minute data were resampled to daily intervals

NWS Coop 
	- raw temperature data are found in file "NWS_coop_505757_csv.txt".
	- Raw data in daily time steps. Flagged temperature values replaced by nans, temperatures converted to celcius, and data resampled to daily indices. 


# ------------------------
3. daily_tavg
# ------------------------
- This file contains daily average temperatures for Gates Glacier, Buri AWS, and USGS sites. The USGS record is complete from
	2016 - 2020, which was accomplished via  gap-filling of missing winter 2018/2019 USGS data using a regression of May Creek site temperatures. 
- For the Buri and Gates sites, average daily air temperatures are identical to those in daily_temperature_data. For USGS however, temperatures
	between 2018-10-10 and 2019-05-08 were filled using the regression equation, y = 0.93(x) + 0.10, where x represents the May Creek air temperature. 
- Columns in this data file are:
	'gates' = daily average air temperature for gates in Celcius
	'buri' = daily average air temperature for Buri AWS in Celcius
	'usgs' = daily average air temperature for USGS in Celcius
