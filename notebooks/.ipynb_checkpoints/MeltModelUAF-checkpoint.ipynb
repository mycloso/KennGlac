    "Next I import a record of measured ablation totals from Kennicott Glacier (KennSummerAblation_NPS+UAF.xlsx). The NPS values were exported from the SQL Glaciers database using a saved query and the UAF values are from Eric Petersen via email 2022_03_17, but then later updated 2022_06_09, and again 2022_08_16. Edit that last notebook if you want to change anything. It is exported with the columns 'Site', 'Date_Time', 'Latitude', 'Longitude', 'HAMSL_m', 'Melt_Season_SWE_Change_m', 'LastVisitDate', 'DaysSinceLastVisit'. I manually added 'IceSnow', which describes the surface that was melting at the beginning/end of the melt season, respectively, 'Summ_Accum_m', which could have been part of the query but I didn't think of it, Debris_Thickness_cm, which only applies if it is a debris-covered site, and Institution (NPS or UAF). Note that melt season change ignores summer accum (reflects the surface under the summer accum), and the summ_accum--when it shows up, stops the melt season (if it persists).\n",
    "\n",
    "Also, there is one duplicate record that comes out of the SQL server export as of 12/4/2021: two versions of Kenn6100 in 2019. The one with a melt season change of -2.805 is preferred, so I manually removed a record with change of -2.746. I also separated out 3 records from Gates 7200 that have such small melt responses that I think they skew the DDF calculation, likely because they received significant mid-summer precip. I called them \"snow/snow/suspect\" in the IceSnow category. This could be fixed in db query somehow in the future."

    "### SUMMARY\n",
    "\n",
    "Degree Day Factors look pretty reasonable. About -5 to -8 mm/degC for ice, more variable -4 to 0 for snow. For ice they look pretty good, except they seem to be a little systematically low at Kenn 2700 and Kenn 2300. Could be my temp relationship doesn't have a big enough lapse rate, but also possible it's because they're anomalously close to moraines or just a little dirty. I think either is possible but we don't have good data to prove either, so we'll just leave them. For ice and snow they are more mixed up, but those are all sites that can potentially receive midsummer snow, especially at Gates 7200, where it isn't necessarily recorded as summer accumulation. In those cases we would find an anomalously low DDF, and I think especially those two with values >-1 that's the case.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, we'll do a regression of all ice sites to get pdd/ice, and we'll exclude the snow/ice completely, and for snow only we'll use all but the two >-1."
